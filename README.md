This game was made by a team consisting of myself, Jennifer Shin, Rafael Gomez, Lino Valdovinos, and Kevin Lynn for our senior design project.

The player must survive as long as possible by clearing each wave of enemies, with each wave increasing in difficulty.

Each character has a certain amount of stamina which drains when they move, and recharges when they stand still. If their stamina reaches 0, they are unable to move until their stamina recharges fully.
